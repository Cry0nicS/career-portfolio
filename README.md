## ðŸŽ® Career portfolio

My first Gatsby playground. This project serves as a practical way to get started with React. The goal was to create a career portfolio trying out various ways of implementing simple components and APIs (like the Trello integration).

While some static data was committed to the repo, most of it is served by Contentful.
